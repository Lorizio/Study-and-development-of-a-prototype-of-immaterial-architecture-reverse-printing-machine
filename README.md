  PROJECT DECRIPTION

  This project introduces the notion of transient materialization through an exploration of the relationship between digital and material-based digital fabrication. The research was inspired by direct observations of nature’s beauty in the form of thin films. The building block of the experiment is an n-hedron structure composed mainly of soap foam, which is blown, through a mixture of air and helium (used to control the physical properties), into a foam structure. The project questions this structure’s materiality, examines its physical performance and ephemeral characteristics, and expands on its meaning through an experiment in digital fabrication. Specifically, in this research, we demonstrate the first phase of this technology and achieve a programmable foam structure. The experiment presents various configurations of dynamic and transformable foam structures on a large scale of fabrication. The fabrication interacts with the algorithm, which involves a mixture of air and helium (controlled by pneumatic valves) and additive chemical substances and thickening agents, all of which exist in a certain space and time. The aim of the project is to take architecture beyond the creation of static forms and into the design of dynamic, transformable and ephemeral material experimental processes. 
  
  This research project successfully combines two key notions: Hardware and Software. Hardware part of the project consists of different components such as air compressor, helium balloon, step motors, direct current motors, relays and installation which fabricates foam itself. Both air compressor and helium balloon have attached pneumatic valves that regulate the incoming level of any of those substances. Further, to be able to control them some electrical schemes using breadboard have been constructed. Speaking about step motors, two Big Easy Drivers in form of mini boards have been used to control them. Concluding, to be able to control all this Hardware, two Arduino boards have been used. Thus the very first issue, before going to the Software part of the project, was to get familiar with each of those Hardware components as well as their combination.
