## Project description
This project introduces the notion of transient materialization through an exploration of the relationship between digital and material-based digital fabrication. The research was inspired by direct observations of nature’s beauty in the form of thin films. The building block of the experiment is an n-hedron structure composed mainly of soap foam, which is blown, through a mixture of air and helium (used to control the physical properties), into a foam structure. The project questions this structure’s materiality, examines its physical performance and ephemeral characteristics, and expands on its meaning through an experiment in digital fabrication. Specifically, in this research, we demonstrate the first phase of this technology and achieve a programmable foam structure. The experiment presents various configurations of dynamic and transformable foam structures on a large scale of fabrication. The fabrication interacts with the algorithm, which involves a mixture of air and helium (controlled by pneumatic valves) and additive chemical substances and thickening agents, all of which exist in a certain space and time. The aim of the project is to take architecture beyond the creation of static forms and into the design of dynamic, transformable and ephemeral material experimental processes. 

## Repository content  
  This research project successfully combines two key notions: Hardware and Software. Hardware part of the project consists of different components such as air compressor, helium balloon, step motors, direct current motors, relays and installation which fabricates foam itself. Both air compressor and helium balloon have attached pneumatic valves that regulate the incoming level of any of those substances. Further, to be able to control them some electrical schemes using breadboard have been constructed. Speaking about step motors, two Big Easy Drivers in form of mini boards have been used to control them. Concluding, two Arduino boards have been used to combine all these Hardware components in order to control the simulation. 
  
  Thus the very first issue, before going to the Software part of the project, was to get familiar with each of those Hardware components as well as their combination, which took quite a bit of time. After setting them up, some test projects were implemented to test their functionality, which are not part of this repository, as well as many other intermediate projects that made it possible to come up with the final solution presented here. The structure and some guidelines how to navigate are explained below.
  
  The Software part of this project is represented as follows. In the root of this repository there are two simple projects to start with: **helium and air control**, as well as **simple step motor control**. To be able to launch the second one and in general any project that uses step motors, an **AccelStepper** library should be imported. This library, as well as some instructions how to use it, can be found in the **lib** folder. There is also a folder called **project_core** in this repository, which has three main projects inside. In general each project consists of **readme** file that gives some useful background and some details making it easier to understand the implementation. Further, it consists of one or multiple **Arduino source** files, as well as **Processing** subfolder, which implements an appropriate user interface. 

  As a general recommendation, it would make sense to start with two simple projects, namely **helium and air control**, as well as **simple motor control**. They provide an overview of how to control the basic Hardware parts of our installation. To proceed with, an Arduino **foam** source code in the **project_core** folder can be analyzed to understand the algorithm, which combines air and helium control to fabricate the staright foam. Further, three main projects can be analyzed which allow to create programmable foam sculptures of different shape, using different interfaces and cutting algorithms behind it. Finishing, a document in the root of repository describing some further issues can be read.
