## Interface

Another way to create different foam sculpture is to use microphone. During this project two possible ways were investigated, using which it should have been possible to create the already known foam fragments: curved and squared. It has been considered to upload a prototype version of interface that uses microphone to draw the squre-shaped foam fragments.

In order to achieve this goal, a **Minim** library was used, which is an audio library developed mainly for **Processing** developing. Its API makes integrating audio into the sketches as simple as possible, while still providing a lot of flexibility. More information about this library and its API can be found on http://code.compartmental.net/minim/.
